# sawig [Simple Application Written In Go]

This application is an excercise allowing me to learn and explore the language called Golang (or simply put Go). The idea is not to delve too much in the design of the application but rather on getting things done and working. In the process I am forced to read the code and application of other peoples code and see how they have managed to implement a particular functionality.
